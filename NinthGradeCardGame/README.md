<h1>What is this program?</h1>
This is a card game I made in Ninth grade for my <b>AP Computer Science: Principles</b> class. The class was my introduction to working with javascript and with a web development mindset. In the class itself, however, we used the <b> code.org </b> platform, not regular HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This program, specifically was created to be submitted alongside an end-of-year <b>AP exam</b> to be graded alongside a rubric to demonstrate my understanding of programming. It was created using a gui that wrapped the html and css involved in creating a website. The Javascript had wrappers as well and did not use the regular DOM. Instead, there were wrappers such as setProperty(), getProperty(), etc. <i>So what is this program?</i> This is a recreation of my card game program that I found the code to one and a half years later from <b>code.org</b> to real HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
